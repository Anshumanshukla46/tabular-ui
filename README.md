# UI Demo

Thank you for having an awesome talk with me! This UI demo showcases the approach I follow to build user interfaces.

Please note that this is not a fully functional UI, but it provides a brief understanding of how I approach UI development.

## Approach

- **React**: The UI is built using the React framework, which allows for modular and reusable components.
- **HTML & CSS**: The UI is styled using CSS, providing a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **React Icons**: The UI utilizes the `@mui/icons-material` package to incorporate icons into various elements.
